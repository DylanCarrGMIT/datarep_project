Intro to Project
----------------
This is intended to be a webapp for keeping track of your media backlog, movies, tv, music etc.

Features
--------
Features clientside routing, 5 components, a mongodb database that is read from to display the backlog, and the client can add new items, update existing items, and delete them from the database.
Users can input the name, year of release, and link an image to be used as a thumbnail for the added items.

Issues
------
Functionality is fine, though the user has to manually refresh the page to see the effect of deleting items. There is a lack of comments however, and the page is very derivative of the lab work.
